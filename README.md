# Portfolio-Website
A website displaying all my accomplishments past and present.

## Frontend
Typescript with Tailwind CSS Styling and React framework.
- TS chosen for static typing and cleaner code with bug checking.
- Tailwind chosen for efficiency.
- React chosen for prebuilt components, state management, and overall faster development.
- (Future addition) Bundling with Parcel for optimization.

## Backend
Java with Spring Boot framework.
- Java is used by many companys in industry and works well with js/ts.
- Spring Boot simplifies the setup/config of Java apps and overhauls the backend work.

## Middleware
Interaction between front and backend done particularly with RESTful APIs.
- General standard for web/ap development.
- Stateless & resource based = scalable & efficient.

## Deployment
Heroku.
- Works with React well.
- Allows log monitoring.

# Future Implementations
Things to do beyond basic website.

## Error Handling
SLF4J for backend, Sentry for frontend.
- Compatibility with Spring Boot.

## CI/CD
Github Actions.
- Automate build deploy processes.

## Testing
JUnit (backend/Java), Postman (APIs), Jest (frontend/ts).
- Ideally utilized throughout production.
